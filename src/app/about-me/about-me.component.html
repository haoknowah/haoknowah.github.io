    <p>	My name is Noah Gaston, I am a computer programmer with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. I have been programming professionally for 1 year. During that time, I have primarily used Java and Spring. I am currently looking for a job that will continue to allow me to enhance my programing skills.</p>
    <p>The programs that I have developed are primarily in Java. For example, one of the programs that I have created was a simple ORM that could be implemented through Java in order to interact with a database. Another program that I created using Java is a simple text-based role-playing game. I developed a program using Spring. This program kept track of a combination of technologies, topics, and curriculum, how they combined and how they interacted through a specific web application.
        For my coworkers at Embassy Suites, I created a program that helps them to create layout diagrams for banquet tables in the conference rooms.

    <p>My long-term goal is to learn how to design a video game with specific game engines. I am currently in the process of learning Unity and C#. </p>
